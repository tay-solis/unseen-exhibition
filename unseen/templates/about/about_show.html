    <p class="about__text">
        Mia, an American conflict photographer, wakes up at the site of a massacre in Syria, not sure how she got there.
        With her Turkish girlfriend Derya and her Californian mother Jane, Mia must slowly piece together the details of
        her past to find out what happened. Mona Mansour’s beautifully human and surprisingly humorous play asks what it
        would mean for our souls—personally and as a nation—if we were to truly see the impact of our actions.
