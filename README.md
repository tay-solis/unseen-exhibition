unseen: Interactive Photo Exhibition

This website is a digital photo gallery created for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in conversation with the West coast debut of [Mona Mansour's unseen](https://www.osfashland.org/productions/2022-plays/unseen). Mia, the protagonist of the show, was inspired by the work of Nichole Sobecki, an award-winning documentary photographer who has worked in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Afghanistan, and all over the African continent. 

This digital gallery showcases Sobecki's work and allows viewers to respond to the images in a "conversation gallery." The site is built with a Django backend with a custom React gallery on the frontend. Styling was handled in SASS. The entire site was deployed to Google Cloud using Docker and Google Cloud Run.

Unfortunately, due to deadline constraitns, this project currently only functions in the production environment.
